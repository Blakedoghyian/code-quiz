    <!--Given I am taking a code quiz
    When I click the start button
    Then a timer starts and i am presented with a question
    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over

    THEN i can save my intials and score-->
